The text files follow this structure:

[number of platforms in a level]

[height of a platform] [length of a platform] [x coordinate] [y coordinate] [*type] [**direction] [movement] [how much the platform moves to the right] [how much the platform moves up] [how much the platform moves per one loop]

p.s. White spaces do not count and enters are placed to make sets of platforms more distinguishable.

*0 - environmental hazard
 1 - a platform to stand on
 2 - a platform to climb
 3 - a filler platform
 4 - decoration (to come...)

**type 0: 1 - up, 2 - left, 3 - down, 4 - right.
  type 1: for clarity always written as 0 but is not affected because it has only one texture.
  type 2: 1 - right, 2 - left.
  type 3: for clarity always written as 1 but is not affected because it has only one texture.
  type 4: to come...
