# WingsOfVirral

Welcome to the Wings Of Virral! ![character jumping](https://github.com/carrottens/WingsOfVirral/assets/60371977/f85b27fe-6d4e-47b6-9e40-2332f093be6b "Lyra Cornelia Batterbee is happy to see you")

## In a nutshell

Wings of Virral is a platformer game programmed using JSFML.

It was conceived during a group project in my second year of university (2020-2021). I have recently refurbished it a little bit as a Java and Javadoc practice.
The older version of the game can be found in the branch OldGame.

## Give credit where credit is due ![character idling](https://github.com/carrottens/WingsOfVirral/assets/60371977/28159e22-7ba6-4750-8d09-62dfe28e2481 "I was made by Nathan!")

Since the origin of the game is a university group project I have to acknowledge that it would have not happened without my team members. We were so proud of such a flawed result because half of our team stopped contributing very early in the development and even as only half of the team we pushed through! I have contacted these two fundamental people but they did not wish to be fully credited so they are referred to only by their names as *`author` Nathan* and *`author` Yujie*.

*`author` Yujie* was responsible for the MainPage and Boss packages as well as ItemJSFML class.
*`author` Nathan* was the team leader and the main concept author. He has drawn all of the art assets for the old game that are also present in the refurbished version (all of the art in the main menu, platform and player textures, game over tablet). He also developed the Player class.

The old version had no boss textures and backgrounds were added to the later version which I do not have, so I could have not made the refurbished version so aesthetically pleasing without the freebies from [craftpix.net](https://craftpix.net/ "2D Game Assets").
In particular: 
* [Robot pack](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-robot-pixel-art-sprite-sheets/?num=3&count=34&sq=robots&pos=0 "FREE ROBOT PIXEL ART SPRITE SHEETS") - Swordsman spritesheets are used for the boss in the laboratory
* [Animated Effects pack](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-animated-explosion-sprite-pack/ "FREE ANIMATED EXPLOSION SPRITE PACK") - laboratory boss shoots the first frame of the "Explosion two colors"
* [Winter Backgrounds pack](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-winter-backgrounds-pixel-art/ "FREE WINTER BACKGROUNDS PIXEL ART") - winter 4 in combination with a few other packs on the site is used as the background for the laboratory
* [Vampire pack](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-vampire-pixel-art-sprite-sheets/ "FREE VAMPIRE PIXEL ART SPRITE SHEETS") - Countess Vampire spritesheets are used in the mannor
* [Fantasy 2D Battlegrounds pack](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-pixel-art-fantasy-2d-battlegrounds/ "FREE PIXEL ART FANTASY 2D BATTLEGROUNDS") - battleground 2 is the background of the mannor

## To infinity and beyond

Everyone is welcome to fork whichever repository and have their fun with it. There is still a lot of room for improvement. There are so many more animations that could be implemented (I have even left some extra spritesheets ðŸ˜›), maybe having a hand with creating more levels by consulting the "structureOfTheLevelFiles.txt" in the Level package resource folder and modifying the "Level1P.txt". Or maybe eradicating wall cliping? I hope my ridiculous amount of comments helps someone or at least helps me when I decide to refurbish it again after two years ðŸ˜†
